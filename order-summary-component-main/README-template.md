## My process

Starting of with this project, I looked at the style-guide and sourced my fonts and colors. Then after linking what I needed to the top of the page I started on my HTML. After getting a foundation down, I moved over to setting up my CSS file and started working on that. I originally had the media query for the background up and running first, but it gave me difficulties once starting to make the card. I ended up dropping that, in favor of increasing the sizing of the card for Desktop view, and giving it a drop shadow to contrast over a two-tone background image. I preferred this choice aesthetically, as I believed it made the whole thing more visually interesting! After having all my sections made inside the card, i moved on to the styling and shaping of the font and the sections themselves. And lastly, I added in the hover effects!  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This one was a bit more challenging for me than my first challenge, mainly due to the fact that I could not get the illustration at the top to marque behind the main card. But after spending a little bit of time trying to sort it out, I found that using "overflow: hidden;" was what i needed to solve the problem! After that speed bump it was smooth sailing!

I am particularly proud of the process payment buttons effects. Though small, it was fun figuring that out! I also learned how to use drop-shadows during this challenge to! I will say that I didn't struggle with any HTML elements this time, and that I feel I definitely learned the most on CSS during this challenge.  

### Continued development

I would love to continue my development by using more animations in the future. But I know that I will also need to learn how to code in an option for "Limited Motion" and "No Animations" so that I can be inclusive of anyone using any accessibility features. I am looking forward to learning so much more!
